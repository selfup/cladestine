Your nodes can talk to eachother using :rpc with safer payloads!

Like agents in the field, nodes need to communicate in a cryptic fashion.

At first is was called _saferpc_ but that's not true. It's just safe(r) function arguments :joy:

You need to set the enviornment variable `RPC_TOKEN` prior to using this! :pray:

Make sure you generate a strong secret :key:
